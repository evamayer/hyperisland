#1. Create a program that reads two integers, *a* and *b*, from the user.
# Your program should compute and display:
    #1. The sum of *a* and *b.*
    #2. The difference when *b* is subtracted from *a*
    #3. The product of *a* and *b*
    #4. The quotient when *a* is divided by *b*
    #5. The remainder when *a* is divided by *b*
    #6. The result of log{10}a
    #7. The result of a^b
#*Hint: *The `math` module may contain some advanced mathematical operations.
# Also you can use the python inbuilt `input()` command to receive input from the user.*
